## About My Project! 

"The Love Yourself Lab" is an uplifting webpage where I designed for it to generate daily self-love affirmation. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project serves as a gentle reminder that you are worthy, capable, and deserving of love, ESPECIALLY from yourself. 

## Why Self-Love Matters...

In a world that constantly demands more from us, self-love is not a luxury-it's a necessity. When practicing self-love, you:

-**Build confidence** within yourself & your abilities. 
-**Reduce stress and the feeling of being anxious** by being kind to yourself instead of making feelings worse. 
-**Attract postitive relationships** when you respect yourself first!
-**Practice resilience and compassion** when handling and navigating challenges. 

## Why I Did This 🤔💭!

I was actually inspired by a client of mine. Whoever works with her, they have to give her compliments at the beginning & end of the day or ELSE.

I started doing it to myself every morning. I sit infront my mirrorand speak affirmations to myself. 

It sounds so simple, but it does so much.

Those few minutes of self-love sets the tone for my entire day. Saying this like: 

**You are going to have an amazing day.""
**There's so many opportunities and doors that are coming to you.*
**I am smart.**

Of course it felt awko at first... but over time, I started believing it. The days I skipped my mirror time, I felt the difference in my mindset & energy. 

This project was born from my routine. A digital companion to remind you of your worth whenever you need it.
